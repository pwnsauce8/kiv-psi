## Assignment #1

Implement an IPv4 UDP multicast client (and server) in any programming language (C# in my project). 

## General info

* *Multicast IP:* 230.0.0.0
* *Multicast port:* 5000

This C# solution contains two projects:

* `psi-1` - is a multicast client. (It only receives messages from the server)
* `psi-1-server` - is a multicast server. (It is only sending messages to a multicast group)

## Setup

To run Server and client:
1. Unzip `run.zip`
2. Open `run` folder
3. Run `run.bat`
